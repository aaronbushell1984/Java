//	Part 1 – Creating a utility class
//	
//	Create a packaged called com.fdmgroup.staticKeywordExercises
//	In this exercise, you’re going to create a utility class which uses Einstein’s famous formula E = MC2 to convert energy to matter and matter to energy.
//	
//	1.	Create the class in the UML above. 
//		a.	The speed of light is 299792458 metres per second.
//		b.	The matter to energy formula is E = MC2
//		c.	The energy to matter formula is M = E / C2
//		
//	2.	Create a class called Runner with a main method. 
//		a.	In the main method call both methods directly from the class (do not create an object of EnergyMatterCalculator). Verify that they produce the correct values.
//
//	Part 2 – Creating a class with a static variable
//	
//	1.	Create the class in the UML below:
//	
//	2.	Create getters and setters for all variables.
//		
//	3.	Modify the setHourlyWage() method so that if its argument is below the minimum wage, the hourly wage is defaulted to being the same as the minimum wage.
//		
//	4.	Create a class called Runner with a  main method.
//	
//	5.	In the main method call the setMinimumWage method directly from the class and pass in a value of 9.53.
//	
//	6.	Create 3 employee objects. 
//	
//	7.	Call the setHourlyWage method on all 3 employee objects. For the first 2 objects, pass in values less than the minimum wage. For the 3rd object pass in a value above the minimum wage.
//	
//	8.	Call the getHourlyWage on all 3 employee objects. Verify that the first 2 are being paid the minimum wage and that the 3rd is being paid above the minimum wage.
